## Where to Swim?

**SWIM HOLE** is an app designed to help users find and keep track of their favorite off-the-grid swimming spots. Users can create new swimming locations based off their coordinates and leave reviews and information about them for others.

## Technologies Used

This app was developed using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, NodeJS, Express, MongoDB, and Mongoose.

## Getting Started

[Swim Hole!](https://swim-hole.herokuapp.com) - link to app.

## Next Steps:

In the future I would like to implement tools to determine coordinates based off the map in the app. I would also like to implement a toggle feature to show whether a given location is in season or not.
